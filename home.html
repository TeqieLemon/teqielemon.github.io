                  I've dreamt of making content since I was 9 but I could never find what was it that I actually wanted to do. With the rebrand I've realised what I want to make and will proceed to make the best content I can.

                  Making music has been a dream of mine for a while now and while I may not be that good at it yet, it is something I genuinely want to dedicate more time into making it as I think of it as a perfect medium to share my emotions.

                  I've been writing ideas for games for a long time and I even started working on a couple of those projects. I may not be good at making them but it's a passion of mine and I love seeing people enjoy what I produce.

                  I always loved collecting stuff, be it cards, stickers or pins but a lot of this stuff costs real money and to collect an entire set you may have to sped a lot more that you wish. These are fully virtual cards tied exclusively to a private bot on my Discord server. Jump in and explore what cards you might be able to get.

                  I play, watch and listen to a lot of stuff. Sometimes that thing is good, sometimes bad, but it's important for me to voice my experience about it if I really love or hate it. This is a place just for that, to let you know what I think about it.
